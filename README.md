# Decimal-Part-Of-PI
An exercise that counts 2 digit numbers in decimal part of PI. 

The solution generated by compiling C++11 on GNU compiler; via TOKEN_LENGTH as 3 is given. 'test.yaml' calico file is used in evaluation.  'pi_approximate' file includes first 10000 digits of pi's decimal part.  Other important notes about these solutions are below;  'static' keyword is used in this solutions. When a variable is declared as static, space for it gets allocated for the lifetime of the program. An array is a contiguous collection of homogeneous elements that can be accessed using an index by [address of first member] + [offset] . In this homework, Token struct contains a char array and an integer that makes implementation possible via TOKEN_LENGTH as 2.
